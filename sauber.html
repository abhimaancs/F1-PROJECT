            <h2>ABOUT SAUBER :</h2>
            <p>Sauber Motorsport AG, commonly known as Sauber F1 Team, is a Swiss Formula 1 racing team with a rich
                history in motorsport. Founded by Peter Sauber in 1970, the team has been a consistent presence in
                Formula 1 since its debut in 1993. Sauber is known for its engineering excellence and commitment to
                innovation.</p>
            <p>Over the years, Sauber has collaborated with various engine suppliers, including Ferrari and BMW, to
                power its cars. The team has had several notable drivers, including Kimi Räikkönen, Felipe Massa, and
                Sebastian Vettel, who have contributed to its success on the track.</p>
            <p>In recent years, Sauber has undergone significant changes, including a partnership with Alfa Romeo,
                leading to the rebranding of the team as Alfa Romeo Racing. Despite these changes, Sauber continues to
                focus on developing competitive cars and nurturing young talent in the sport.</p>
