            <h2>ABOUT ASTON MARTIN :</h2>
            <p>Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team is a British Formula One racing team and constructor. The team
                is based in Silverstone, England, and is owned by a consortium led by Canadian businessman Lawrence
                Stroll. Aston Martin returned to Formula One as a constructor in 2021 after a long absence, having
                previously competed in the sport from 1959 to 1960.</p>
            <p>The team's return to Formula One was marked by a significant investment in both infrastructure and
                talent. Aston Martin has partnered with Mercedes-AMG for power units and technical support, which has
                helped the team become more competitive on the grid. The team's car for the 2021 season, the AMR21,
                featured a striking green livery that paid homage to Aston Martin's racing heritage.</p>
            <p>Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team has made significant strides in its performance since its
                return to the sport. With experienced drivers like Sebastian Vettel and Lance Stroll, the team aims to
                establish itself as a consistent contender in the highly competitive world of Formula One racing.</p>
